# nci-checker

5-Jan-2016: 
- Note that this readme should eventually include instructions on how to export the checker directory to the python path, that way it can be run globally.

- Also note, we might want future ability to know whether certain groups of ACDD attributes are all used together or not (e.g., if using geospatial_lat_min, did the _lat_max get used as well).
